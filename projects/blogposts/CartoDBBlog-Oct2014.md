##Pulse Plotting: the Vital Signs of Water Gauging in TZA 
###10/10/14 | Brooklyn NYC

There's a part of Paul Ford's talk [10 Timeframes](http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/10-timeframes/), where he goes over the various incrementations we apply to our daily lives and how our understanding of time with the advent of computers has become progressively more infintessimal, down now to the nanosecond. Eventually, he settles on the "heartbeat" as the most genuine temporal segment, selected for its consistency in tenoring time, and for its humanity. 

Often when we build digital things, I think we emphasis the mechanics of it over the human expressive potential they enable. There's a humanism to making maps, human-designed guides for global navigation, and sometimes I get the opportunity to plot data to a map like the thumpthump of a heartbeat on our planet; somehow feebily expressive of the natural breath and health of our globe as it grows. I work for a tech company that builds open source tools to crowdsource mapping accross the planet; we're called Ushahidi, a word that means "witness"" in Swalhili. Occasionally, we dabble in plugging sensor data into deployments of our self-titled mapping platform. The resulting projections are a kind of crowdsourcing, like the reports and UGC we generally port to populate our maps, but with sensor data, you get an objective read on the natural wealth and environmental health of a place, from weather gauging, to temperature and chemical readings to seismic conditions that provide a pulse to our planet. Vital Signs is an NGO whose objective is to do just that, read the pulse of east African argriculture and sustainability in sensor data collected across Tanzania, and this blog post is about a map we built for their team to help monitor that water gauging stations in the SAGCOT district of TZA.
