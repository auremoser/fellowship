####There Must Be a Pony Somewhere: Digging in Data to Find a Story

At this week's MIT Civic Media Conference, Joi Ito kicked off an introductory talk with a nod to his coder fellow, Mat, a "unicorn" journalism-coder-analyst

The most prize-worthy ponies deserve compensation and reward

Let's talk about empathy. 
#####Joi Ito

`unicorn - Mat (journalism)`

Quote investigator wrote a cute quip about the origins of this quote (http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/12/13/pony-somewhere/), and lately it has me thinking about a job I share with many techy-journalists: digging through data (evidence) for a story (pony). The metaphor carries through to building a data journalism team, composed of a ragtag herd of unicorns, racehorses, and as I'd like to identify, ponies.

When we think about endurance and the persistance of applications, we sometimes think about the ephemerality of our work. What happens when the horserace is over; how will we remember our efforts? We're tackling that next month at the Digital Preservation Conference 2014.

your company is a herd of ponies (http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/your-company-is-not-a-family/), the author uses the analogy of sports teams and the mentions of the spurs made me think that the pony metaphor might be as ridiculously apt.
The Spurs stand out for the stability and longevity of their player relationships, yet even their current 13-man roster only includes one player from their first championship in 1999: power forward Tim Duncan.
