There Must Be a Pony Somewhere: Digging in Data to Find a Story
Quote investigator wrote a cute quip about the origins of this quote (http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/12/13/pony-somewhere/), and lately it has me thinking about a job I share with many techy-journalists: digging through data (evidence) for a story (pony). The metaphor carries through to building a data journalism team, composed of a ragtag herd of unicorns, racehorses, and as I'd like to identify, ponies.
