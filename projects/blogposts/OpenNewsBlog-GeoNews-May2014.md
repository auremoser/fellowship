There Must Be a Pony Somewhere: Digging in Data to Find a Story
Quote investigator wrote a cute quip about the origins of this quote (http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/12/13/pony-somewhere/), and lately it has me thinking about a job I share with many techy-journalists: digging through data (evidence) for a story (pony). The metaphor carries through to building a data journalism team, composed of a ragtag herd of unicorns, racehorses, and as I'd like to identify, ponies.

When we think about endurance and the persistance of applications, we sometimes think about the ephemerality of our work. What happens when the horserace is over; how will we remember our efforts? We're tackling that next month at the Digital Preservation Conference 2014.
