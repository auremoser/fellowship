2014 Open News Fellow - Ushahidi

------
My name is Aurelia and I'm a [2014 Open News Fellow](http://opennews.org/fellowships/2014meet.html) at Ushahidi and Internews Kenya. You may have read about me on [previous blogs](http://blog.ushahidi.com/2014/03/07/introducing-new-additions-to-the-team-pt-1/), and not read much since. Among Ushahidians, I'm a little anomalous: my work is a funny little footnote on some of the epic projects that Ushahidi tackles normally, so I thought I'd blog a bit about my random contributions. My time splits in fits and starts between [Mozilla Open News](opennews.org/) meetings and collabo-hack projects, Ushahidi projects, and [Internews](http://internewskenya.org/) projects, all under the umbrella of fusing journalism and technology in an open source ethos.

On the daily, I'll work on ways to prototype small visualizations and data projects with the Ushahidi crew, write code to promote Ush partner projects like BRCK and the Savannah Fund with operations and analytics tools, and find ways to tell stories with datasets at Internews. My mandate is pretty broad and aggressively collabortive, so I can address a variety of project types and partners. Sometimes I contribute to interactive news stories like Internews' [Landquest](http://landquest.internewskenya.org/), sometimes I'll build simple project management tools like Ushahidi's [Pirate Plotr](https://github.com/auremoser/pirateplotr), sometimes I get to do cool fusion projects and bring Usha tools into journalism narratives, like my current work with Chambua on text analysis for [an Internews story](https://github.com/internews-ke/hiv-30/tree/master/Sentiment_Analysis). Sometimes I speak at events like [HOPE-X](http://www.hope.net/), participate in hackathons like [Media Hack Day](http://www.mediahackdays.com/), or otherwise hack away at side-projects, like [news apps](https://github.com/auremoser/geonewsies/), my [radio show](http://aureliamoser.com/projects/radio/), [Girl Develop It](http://girldevelopit.com/chapters/new-york), or my [Nodebots community meetup](http://www.meetup.com/nodebots/).

Most of my work is a beautiful chimera of random creative and collaborative endeavors, what many might call *odd,* but what most days feels pretty *outstanding.*
