TULLOW EMPLOYMENT DATA
Hi Eva,
To make our analysis simpler, I made two new fusion tables.
* one has Counts/Percentages of Laborers by company, level, and origin (all of the same info as before (corrected to exclude the “totals” rows)
* two has total info of Laborers (counts) by company and origin

From one, for example, you can tell the percentage of expats as “skilled” or “unskilled”
From two, for example, you can tell there is a total of 46 Turkanas in a total workforce of 69 at the AFEX Group

Basically, you can get skill level information from the former, strict totals from the latter.

I had to correct the percentages from the spreadsheet because some of them didn’t add up to 100% by company and was making the data look weird.

Here are my responses to your lines of investigation based on these tables. I can build a visualization that could illustrate number of Skill levels by company. Let me see what I can get the data to do and I’ll get back to you with updates, hopefully tomorrow!

1.) There are a couple of different lines of investigation we are going to follow:

Companies that have the most expat and non-Turkana labor overall and find out why

According to my munging, the following companies have the most Expat/NT:

PR Marriot	34/56 or 61% expat	20% NT
GGS		23/94 or 24% expat	2% NT
Baker Hughes	66/97 or 68% expat	32% NT
Weatherford	24/105 or 23% expat	33% NT
Schlumberger	81/119 or 68% expat	32% NT
Sakson		86/126 or 68% expat	2% NT

Almost all other groups have a high-percentage (in this case, over 20% of their workforce listed as “Non-Turkana”. 
Exceptions include:
KK Security	87/92	or 95% T
Newport	Totals	102/114	or 89% T
Tullow/ROLSS	147/147 or 100% T

*”most” is relative here, because Halliburton technically has the “most” expats, 100% of its workforce, but they only have 1 worker. To correct for this, I evaluated % and not counts of laborers, so anything above 20% of the total workforce by company was considered among the “highest”

I attached a spreadsheet to illustrate this, with total counts by company and those “of interested” highlighted (this is the same data in the fusion tables).


2. The companies that have the most unskilled labor filled by expats and non-Turkana and why.

Sakson has all of the unskilled expat laborers (14 in total)
NT unskilled counts are below (12 total unskilled NT laborers)
BGP - 3
TAI - 5
New Edge Solutions - 3
AFEX Group - 1
This chart
 

3. The companies that have few unskilled or skilled positions and why (ie are they inflating the level of their positions to justify having more expats? There is a good example of a concrete pouring company and catering company with all high level positions)

Companies with the fewest unskilled:
KK Security (0 unskilled)
Baker Hughes (0)
Citiscape (0)
Earthview (0)
Freight Forwarders (0)
Kurrent Technologies (0)
New Edge (3 NT)
Spica Marine Inspections
Alpha Logistics (0)
Halliburton (0)
Schlumberger (0)
Transeast (0)


4. Companies that only have Turkana employees (the largest) and find out whether they have a fair and open contracting process
Tullow/ROLS is the only company with 100% Turkana employees.
KK Security (95%) and Newport (89%) have the next largest percentages.



5. Companies that have semi-skilled positions and look at the job titles to investigate how much training it would take for Turkanas to fill those positions
ROLSS has many semi-skilled positions (no unskilled). 
Sakson
TAI
Newport
KK Security
GGS
Weatherford
Ardan
BGP 
The following grouped bar chart shows counts of semi-skilled worker by contractor, each bar represents a Expat/NT/T count as well as totals of semi-skilled workers.


 
6. We might discuss which gives the most accurate representation of proportions, for example, if people intuitively understand what the whole is for the percentages.

I think a stacked or grouped bar chart showing counts across all contractors
Maybe a pie chart of skill level “dispersion” for each Expat/NT/T
Then depending on what we think is the most interesting company we can do some other charts by company.
Then perhaps we can make a cleaner version of the data available and invite people to study it themselves.
