Vital Signs Project
=========
##General Notes
* objective is to create a feedback loop for responsible and sustainable agricultural practice with the ecosystem in mind
* to provide for grassroots environmental monitoring in east africa
* create an accessible information resource -- globally

## Questions
* Audience? Connectivity and infrastructure level or browser dependencies?
* Deadline?
* Data structure?

##Ideas
* syncing up with Rose Goslinga : we do micro crop insurance for around 200,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda; satellite imagery to track rainfall and payouts to farmers via MPESA, the impact is that these payouts allow farmers to replant as well as get new loans/ or debt forgiveness from their banks.
* Standing water shapefile. Maybe useful if thereâ€™s an interest in comparing physical stressors and political/social unrest. http://www.unitar.org/unosat/node/44/1690
