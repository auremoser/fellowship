Vital Signs Project
=========
##General Notes
* objective is to create a feedback loop for responsible and sustainable agricultural practice with the ecosystem in mind (sustainable agricultural production)
* to provide for grassroots environmental monitoring in east africa
* create an accessible information resource -- globally
* Sara spent 2 weeks in the field (Ghana and Tanzania- TZA)
* [SOILS] Have equistration points collected (**e plot**) accross a country + **Survey data **from farmers + pricing data, **roadside vegetation surveys**
* [WATER] Water monitoring; meteorological sensors (stevenson screen: rainfall, temperature, humidity sensors, streaming to internet)
* [WEATHER] Rainfall is the only thing that really changes, climate is stable; rainfall and water
* [SATELLITE IMAGERY] > [SOURCE SAMPLES]

## Questions
* Audience? Connectivity and infrastructure level or browser 
	* decisionmakers + influencers if I change this in agricultural policy
* dependencies?
* Deadline?
	* 2 weeks
* Data structure?

##Ideas
* grid plot data - 100 meters (measurements over a grid)
* camera image at every plot > color coded map of plots (which year they've done)
* classifications of vegetation types + water [basin](maji.go.tz/bassins)
* weather, no access >forecast io + [weather underground](http://www.wunderground.com/global/TN.html) + Weather map
* syncing up with Rose Goslinga : we do micro crop insurance for around 200,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda; satellite imagery to track rainfall and payouts to farmers via MPESA, the impact is that these payouts allow farmers to replant as well as get new loans/ or debt forgiveness from their banks.
* Standing water shapefile. Maybe useful if thereâ€™s an interest in comparing physical stressors and political/social unrest. http://www.unitar.org/unosat/node/44/1690
