TRADE IN BLOOD SHAKEN BY DISEASE SCARE

PARIS, Monday
Kxports of blood from the United
Slates are under attack ¡n Europe
because of moral issues and fear
of (he deadly. Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome (Aids).
You do not have to be homosex
ual or addicted to drug to gel
Aids, although those two groups.
as well as hemophiiiaes. are con
sidered at the highest risk.
A transfusion can transmit the
disease, and that has stirred fears
unabated by assurances From
experts tJat the actual chances of,
getting Aids rmm a transfusion at
this point appear minuscule.
Some experts say commercial
bhx,d from paid donors is mure
likely to carry Aids and hepatitis
than blood [rum unpaid donors.
a contention refuted by he
industry and the US Food and
l)rug Administration.
Others, including the Inter
national Red Çrosa, believe it is
simply immoral to profit from
blond and wanL to replace the
approximately 20 multinational
commercial blood lirms with
government or volunteer
programmes.
But tens of thousands of
hernophi liacs in Western Europe
and the rest of the world depend
heavily on commercial bLQod
¡)FOdUCtS.
Government programme and
the Red Cross, which provide an
adeqiwic supply nl whole blood,
cannot now meet the demand for
plasma and other blood
derivatives and it would cost
milliiuis of tax dollars to till lhe
gap.
So about 70 ner cent uf th
world’s plasma and blood
products comes from commercial
firms. And almost all of that
comes (rom paid donors in the
United States.
The commercial industry
produces about 65 million litres
uf plasma a year, according to
International Federation of Phar
piaceutical Manufacturajs
Associations (IFPMA) in Zurich.
About 25 per cent is sold in North
America. 41 per cent is exported
to Europe. 29 per cent to Asia
and 5 per cent to Lalin America
and the Middle Kast.
A bhoiriaiis, Piet J.
Hspn, says in his book, ffiood.,
(hit or Merchandise that in
19M, the American cosmetics
giant Revlon earned $85 millirn
(Shl.16 billion) from the sale of
bl,ood Droducts. In that same
year, the West German phar .
n4aceuticai group Bayer earned
$130 million (8h4.52 billion),
while the US drug company
Haxter Ttavenol took in $345
inilliin (Sh4.75 billion), he says.
Hagen, who cxined the ‘Opec.
of blood” phrase, says all three
firms used blood from paid
donors in the United States.
Well intormed public health
sources outside the industry say
the commercial companies are
ethical firms which invest heavily
in the research that has been
responsible (or all the recent
major breakthroughs in the field.
“People just get emotional
because it involves human
bkxd,” said a representative of
the World Health Organisation
Geneva, who requested
anonymity. “There’s also a little
politics involved. The Red Cross
may be a little jealous about the
industry’s success in its
traditional domain.”
The Food and Drug
Administration, which sets slnct
rules for blood collection in the
United States, has stated thai
“no available data
detñonst rate” thàt plasma from
paid donors is less safe than non
commercial plasma.
A spoloeswnman ibrihe IFPMA
‘says the image of a bum lining up’
to sell a pint of blood so he can
buy a pint o wine is “very out
dated.t The WHO official says
th typical paid donor is more
likely to be a “strapping young,
college football playèr who needs
a little extra cash for a weekend
date.”
Hut after recent headlines
throughout Western Europe
about Aids — dubbed here the
“gay cancer from America” —
the European Parliament called
for total European self.
sufficiency in blood and blood
products from non commercial
sources.
Ol’ficial8 of the Institute
Pasteur Production in Paris,
which manufactures an anti 
hepatitis vaccine from blood,
held a news conference earlier
this month to announce they had
all injected themselves with a
batch of the vaccine to prove to
the public that it wassale.
i’hat extraordinary measure
was taken after the newspaper
Libera(ujn revealed thai the
institute, short of non ,
cnmmerialeFrench plasma, had
produced the batch from
American commercial imports
without informing its customers.
‘l’he incident also
embrrasscd the French Govern
ment, which had gone out of its’
way earher to assure its citizens
that France was self.suflicient in
blood and blood producta.
I),’ Juhan Likola, director of
blood programmes for the League
of Red CF0HS Scieties in
Geneva, inis(s there is some dif
ference in the safety between
dulninercial and nun coin niercjal
plasma, but adds that “as far as
tm nslùsions are concerned. Aids.
has been exaggerated.”
It is an argument ‘that reaches.
almost theological proportions.”
according to Mr Frank Schnabel,
president of the Montreal.
based World Federation (ii
Hemophilia. “h gets vers
emotional.”
And Itis anargunient, accom.
panied by scare headlines, that
may be frightening people
unnecessarily and endangering
 the lives of hemophiliacs lea
of continuing life sustai
treat,nent.
“There is a real fear ot Aids
among hernophiliacs and their
families —young parents worried
about treating their children. A
panic.” said Mr Roger Barilliet.
secretary general of the Associa 
lion of French Hemophiliacs.
The danger of hepatitis ¡s much
more serious, and hemophiliacs
are well aware of that risk. For
some reason Aids scares
hemophiliacs more than
hepatitis,” he said.
By all accounts, the chançes of
getting Aids from a transfusion
are minuscule, But nine
het’osexuaI hetnophiliacs in the
•Uniìed States, three in Spaiii and
OflO ¡O Caiiada have died of Aids,
following transfusions, M r•
SchnabI says. ,
“There’s a kind of hysteria
..bou( Aids, but we’re lusink more
hemophiliacs due to the
withholding uf treai ment by
doctors worried about Aids or
frightened patients withdrawing

mAids,” hesaid.
