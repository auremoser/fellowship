HOLLAND'S LATEST AIDS CAMPAIGN TARGETS TEENS
Policy is not to scare people.

By a Correspoident
Information on Aids is wide
spread in the Netherlands, so it is
almost impossible for most young
people to be ignorant of the basic
facts. Leaflets are available in
post offices and libriries, at local
health centres and at the many
organisations ,that deal with ho
mosexuality, drug addiction, and
guidance on health and, sexuality.
Masa media regularly address
the problem, especialLy during a
n.ationai campaign, and people
.. who really want all the details
can telephone one, of the national
or local mforznaton lines.  
AL the end of 1988 there were
just over 600 registered Aids pa  .
tienta, largely homosexuals, drug
users or a combination of both.
The number of people with HIV
is estimated at between l50OQ
and 30,000. These figures corn !
pare well jth countries likec .
France and West Germany, bute :
that is no reason for complacen  3 L
cy. With 37 cases per one million
inhabitants the Netherlands is
still well up in the top .10 of’
Europe as far as prevaIence is
concerned.
“We realise that Aids is a
national issue, so we have a mes
age for everybody,” says Bert.
Eijrond of the NCAB, (the
National Committee on Aids),
founded and financially suppaj’t
ed by the Dutch Government.
.‘
Scary diseâse
Since its formatiofl  1978, he
Committee has initiated a aetiee
ut natíonal campaigns, and co
ordinated and supported initia
tives by several organisations like
the Rutgers Stichttng, the Dutch
Familý Planning Association
.(FPA).
. “Our aim is two fold,” Eijrond
explains. “In the fIùt place we
want to stop the .preað of 211V,
the virus that causes Aids. In the
second place we want to control
the reactions of society. We are
trying to emphaaise that Ad is
not some scary disease, causad by
homosexuals and drug adicta.
There is nothing to be afraid of,
as long as people know what they
are doing. In short,.  we want to
stop the negative.dige that un
questionably creep in.”
The first national campaign, in
1987, was meant to inform the
public in a matter of fact way,
mainly trying to avoid sl kinds of
prejudiced reactions. The secouA.
campaign, launched iApril
1988, was particularly diectW at
those wbo come ipto contact with
blood in the course of their work.
Apart from these nationwide
campaigns the NCAB has aimed
publicity at particular groups
thought at risk, such as intrave
nous drug users, homosexuals,
and heemophilliacs.
In accordance with the wishes
of the Dutch parliament, a third
hational campaign has been run
niag since the end of Last Octo
ber, this time directed at vounv
peop1e, their parents and their
, teachers.
So far extremely few young
people have been found to be in
tected. But a campaijn advising a
change in sexual behaviour Is
necessary, nevertheLess, Eijrond
points out. By making use of the
mass inedia and the schooLs, he
says the NCAB can reach all
young people,’ including those
who may put themselves at risk
through their behaviour the
future. ...,
Four choices
. “As in .U the other campaigns,
our policy is, to inform people
without scaring them and with
out forcing upon them all kinds
. of moral jucigernents. We. don’t
want young people to become
‘averse to sex or to blame homo 
IZWsIS. What we offer them are
. four choices. You can have no sex
: ia all, you can bave sex with a
permanent partner you are sure
of, you can use a condom or you
can. employ other ways of making
lose. We don’t make a choice.
j ‘l’bat is up to them,” be says.
, • , The message is brought home
. Ip ,many ways, varying from leaf 
, lets and teLev ion commercials to
‘ special projocas for adolescents
and a series of three television
programmes by Dutch Educa.
tiol Television.
. The Rutgers Stlchting is one of
the oranieaLions involved in the
ergppign. As a centre for family
pbing and matters concerning
sexuality, the FPA has built up
much expertise in the field of the
sexual education of adolescen
. Even before the start o
National Committee, infor  
tian on Aids had been integrated
into sexual education pro
grammes for young people.
“Integration has always been
our starting point,” emphasises
Dóortje Braeken, in charge of the
prevention and guidance policy at
the Rutgers Stiehting.
