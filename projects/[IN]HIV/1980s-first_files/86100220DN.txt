bic Diseases, Dr. T. K. amp
Swngok, which was given to
newsmen yesterday during a
workshop on Aids at the Impala
Hotel in Nairobi.
Aids was tiret discovered in the
United States and Western
iurope in 1981 but sonic studies
mdicate that first canes may have
occurred as early as 197$, Dr
Siongok said.
He said the virus causing Aids
is now called HIV (Human
lmmunodeticiency Virus) and its
incubation period ranges from six
months to five years or even
longer.
Dr Siongok said that not all
carriers of the vir’js were sick
and no one knew who transmit
ted the diseases and who did not.
Two thirds of carriers who had
been followed did not show any
signs of Aids even after five
years, he added.
‘l’he disease destroys the
immune system and this results
In’oppor(uništic infections or
diseases that do not, easily occur
in thoêe with “complete” immune
systems, he said.
L)r Siongok said the Aids virus
could be transmitted through
sexual contact — more com
monly in homosexuals than
heterosexuals — and this
included semen donation,
exposure to blood from infected
individuals and infected mothers
to chìldren during and shortly
aher delivery. The VUUS is not
transmitted by blood sucking
insects. tod or water, he added.
• Aids is a worldwide proIlem
and international co operation
and efforts must be made to curb
and eliminate the disease, Dr
Siongok said.
Another Kenyan Aids expest,
Dr L). M. Owili, said a person
could not be termed an Aids
carrier br showing some of the
disease symptoms.
A person must have all the
eight Aids symptoms and must
undergo several laboratory tests
before being suspected of having
aids, I» Owilj said. "}
