WHO experts warn on screening of Travellers
GENEVA, Wednesday
lxperts convened by the World
Health Organisation said today
that screening international
travellers for Aids could only
briefly slow the spread of what
h&s become a global epidemic.
After two days of consultations,
the panel said a better way woulo
be education programmes tc
increase awareness of how the
Aids virus is transmitted and how
infection can be prevented.
A tótal of 41,919 cases of the
Acquired immune Deficiency
Syndrome in 91 countries were’
reported as of February 26 to
WHO Experts said the epidemic
was now global and that virtually
all nations are involved.
Summing up the panel’s
findings at a press conference, Dr
Jonathan Mann, the American
director of WHO’s special
programme on Aida, said experts
were “highly sceptical about the
travellers
value of screening.”
He pointed out that infected
individuals could take weeks or
even months to test positive for
Aids. Negative resulta,
therefore, could be misleading
and people be less cautious n
their sexual practices.
“Not only may screening be
extraordinarily expensive and
extraordinarily complicated and
raise a range of social issues
societynay not be prepared to
handle, but (it) will have only a
margitial benefit and might even
have the reverse effect inten
ded,” Dr Mann added.
“The consultation concluded
that, at best and at great cost,
HIV (Aids virus) screening of’
international travellers would
retard only briefly the spread of
HIV, both globally and with
respect to any particular coun
try,” said a paper read by Dr
Mann. (AP) "}
