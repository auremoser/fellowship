UNCIRCUMSCISED MALES MORE PRONE TO AIDS

Uncircumcised people and those with genital ulcers who sleep with prostitutes and other high risk partners stand a higher chance of getting Aids.
A study conducted on prostitutes at Pumwani area in Nairobi and
their clients who catch venereal
diseases including genital ulcers,
indicate that uncircumcised
males are more susceptible to the
human immune deficiency virus
(HIV) that causes the Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome
Dr William Cameron, a Canadian
researcher associated with the
university nf Nairobi, said.
Dr Cameron said sexual trans
mission of the Aids virus in.
creased in the presence of other
venereal diseases. especially
those resulting in ulcers like
those caused by a macro Organ
ism called heamophillus ducreyi.
He said diseases like to HIV
infection tended to be mild and
often silent or subclinical.
“Mass control of sexually 
transmitted diseases, especially
the genital ulcer disease, may re
duce the spread of the Aids
virus.”
Foreskin
Three other researchers told
the Naiwn that the presence of
the foreskin in uncircumcised
men with genital ulcers probably
increases the surface area avail
able for infection, but warned
that people should not rush to
prostitutas or other high risk
groups just because they are cir
cumcised. They may still catch
Aids.
The afternoon session on sexu
ally transmitted diseases attract
ed a record crdwd who filled all
the available space in Kemri con
ference hail.
Another speaker said there was
need for continuous education on
aids.
Presenting findings of a survey
carried out in Nyeri District on
how much people know of the
disease, Mrs Anne M. Pertet of
Kemri said that when her team
camed out the survey last Octo
ber and November, 90 per cent of
the respondents said they had
heard of Aids but a number of
them thought it was no longer a
problem since it was no longer
publicised.
The survey found that 41.5 per
cent of the people aged between
60 and 78 had not heard of Aids.
The researchers found that
people in the district were aware
that Aids was transmitted
through sexual intercourse, but
they also were under the miscon
ception that it could be spread
through hand shakes, sharing the
same room utensils, clothing and
other facilities. Six of the 915 re
spondents even thought one
could catch Aids from the air.
Among the population that was
surveyed, blood contact, contami
nate needles and homosexuality
were not known as major meth
ods of transmission.
The people who thought the
population can contract Aids
through sharing the same room,
utensils and other facilities did
not see how it could be prevented.
The researchers therefore recom
mended a massive education
campaign on Aids prevention.
Asked who was most likely to
get Aids, 51.4 per cent of the
people said prostitutes, 8.6 per
cent said single men and women.
per cent said promscous men
and women, 6 per cent thought
men were at greater risk. 4.9 per
cent said town dwellers, while 3.6
per cent said everybody was et
risk. The rest of the respondents
gave other answers including ho.
mosexuals, drunkards, tourists,
hospital staff, while 10.1 per cent
did not know.
Limiting sexual activity Lo one
partner was the answer given by
most. people interviewed in this
survey when asked how best the>
thought Aids could be controlled,
but a staggering 28.4 per cent did
not know what can be done to
control Aids.
The survey showed that most
people had heard about Aids ei
ther from other people or from
the radio. They preferred to
the information through ch
barazas as they felt this we ,
most people would get to know
about Aids.
In another presentation, Dr P.
Datta of the University of
Nairobi said mothers whose in
fants failed to thrive within the
first nine months of life could be
having the human immunodefi
ciency (HIV). .
Dr Datta was presenting a pa
per on “HIV prenatal exposure
effect on infant growth”.
In their study, Dr Datte and
others found that prenatal expo
sure to maternal HIV infection
did not affect the birth weight of
infants nor their gestational a .
However, within nine mont ,
the study showed that infants of
HIV infected mothers lagged be
hind in weight as compared to
those whose mothers were not in
fected with HEy.
Pre natal
111V is the Aids causing
Another researcher said up to
75 per cent of the strains of bac
teria which cause gonorrhea are
resistant to penicillin.
Therefore, there is an urgent
need Lo find cheaper and accept
able alternate drugs for the
teatment of pencilhin resist.ant
gonorrhea, Professor Wamola of
the University of Nairobi said.
He was presenting findings on
a tria) which compared the effec
tiveness of two alternate drugs
which are used to treat pencillin
resistant gonorrhea.
The two drugs, norfioxacin and
spectionomycin, both showed to
be at least 90 per cent effective in
single doses, for the teatment of
penicillin resistant gonorrhea.
In a contribution from the
floor, Mr E. Itotia of Upjohn
company, a drug manufacturing
firm, said that spectionomycin
was not a new drug as it had been
in use for 18 years, and ita price .
in Sh43 a dose and npt Sh170 as
claimed in some quarters.
He said spectionomycin was
therefore not exoensive

prone to Aids’ "}
