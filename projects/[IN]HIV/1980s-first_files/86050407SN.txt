By EDWARD KITAIA
A spread of Acquired Immune
Deficiency Synd’rome (AIDS),’
better known locally as “slim”
disease because of its extreme
wasting characteristic, has
‘ become a major cause of concern
to both government officials and
ordinary citizens in Uganda. The
general public ¡a scared, socia]
habits, especially as they relate to
‘sex, have changed, and local
newspapers Continue to run
screaming headlines about the
“emaciating scourge”.
While officials try to minimise
the fear that the disease, which
was first noticed in 1982 in the
south.western districts of Rakai
and Masaka (bordering on north.
western Tanzania)1 could instil
in people, they have found it
necessary to advise the public on
bow best to avoid contracting
“slim”, The Health Education
Division (HET,)) of the Ministry of
Health recently issued and dis
tributed thousands of warning
postera reading, in large bold
script: “Beware of slim (Afl)S)
disease.”
ProminenUy displayed on walls
of hospitals, government offices 
and other public places, the
posters advise on signs,
symptoms, modes of transmission
and possible ways of prevention
of aide,
Intimate sexual contact., infec.
ted blood used for transfusion
purposes, as well a. con
tamiminated, insterjIjsed
syringes and needles plus other
sharp but unclean instrum.nta
used for ritual activities are
among the factors blamed for the
spread of the deadly disease,
People, the poster. advise,
therefore, should limit the
number of their sexual partners,
avoid sexual relations with “per
sons of high risk and who have
many sexual partners”, use
condoms during intercourse, have
blood transfusion only when
strictly medically necessary, and
ensure that needles, stringea and
other instruments used to pierce
the skin (eg for tabooing cir
cwficijon, ear piercing) are clean
and sterile.
As the posters suggest most
AIDS infections are attributed to
iexual promiscuity. But it must
e pointed out that since
homosexuality is virtually non
existent in Uganda, the tranz
mission je therefore almost
entirely heterosexual.
The increase in the incidence o
the killer disease is as frighten ini
as it is controversial. Week!,
Topic, a faitl’ regardec

Kampala, claimed on March 2
that as many as 100 people were
dying of AIDS every month in
the Masaka and Rakai districts,
identified so far a. the area where
the disease is most common,
The paper went on, however, to
quote Health Minister Dr
Ruhakana Rugunda as saying
this figure was “much too
exaggerated” and that 20 to 30
qr month wa more Dccurate,
The situation is certainly
erìous, but it is not a question of
numbers, Even 20 is bad enough”
the Minister is quoted as Saying.
Weekly Topic went on to report
tl)at at least one AIDS patient
was admitted to Mulago, the
maì government hospital in
Kampala which has a capacity of
about 300. Focus, another
independent paper, reported on
March 27 that “slim” had “in.
flitrated into Kampala” and
already 6 residents of the city had

Saying the group most
vulnerable to AIDS  the

precautionary measures such as
Putting on dondorns while going
for sex o avoiding the habit of
. kissing.”
The Star, an independent daily,
reported on April 24 thaU 30
people had died of AIDS in
Rukungiri, another eoutb.wes

50 other slim patients are on their
death beds,’ said the paper,
