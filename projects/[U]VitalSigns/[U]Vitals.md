Vital Signs Project
=========
##General Notes
* objective is to create a feedback loop for responsible and sustainable agricultural practice with the ecosystem in mind (sustainable agricultural production)
* to provide for grassroots environmental monitoring in east africa
* create an accessible information resource -- globally
* Sara spent 2 weeks in the field (Ghana and Tanzania- TZA)
* [SOILS] Have equistration points collected (**e plot**) accross a country + **Survey data **from farmers + pricing data, **roadside vegetation surveys**
* [WATER] Water monitoring; meteorological sensors (stevenson screen: rainfall, temperature, humidity sensors, streaming to internet)
* [WEATHER] Rainfall is the only thing that really changes, climate is stable; rainfall and water
* [SATELLITE IMAGERY] > [SOURCE SAMPLES]

## Questions
* Audience? Connectivity and infrastructure level or browser 
	* decisionmakers + influencers if I change this in agricultural policy
* dependencies?
* Deadline?
	* 2 weeks
* Data structure?

##Ideas
* grid plot data - 100 meters (measurements over a grid)
* camera image at every plot > color coded map of plots (which year they've done)
* classifications of vegetation types + water [basin](maji.go.tz/bassins)
* weather, no access >forecast io + [weather underground](http://www.wunderground.com/global/TN.html) + Weather map
* syncing up with Rose Goslinga : we do micro crop insurance for around 200,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda; satellite imagery to track rainfall and payouts to farmers via MPESA, the impact is that these payouts allow farmers to replant as well as get new loans/ or debt forgiveness from their banks.
* Standing water shapefile. Maybe useful if there’s an interest in comparing physical stressors and political/social unrest. http://www.unitar.org/unosat/node/44/1690

####Eplot data:
@Aurelia - the Eplot starts at the SouthEast corner (ie. that's subplot 1)

Annotated eplot data had details about location

hi all.... all the datafiles in the VitalSigns dropbox are now in the data catalogue.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qNCbGnXPloRGf4UBCfiDD4rtk8x_FqtEis2Nfx43a-w/edit#gid=1793132675

Aurelia - you needed the corner locations for all the E-plot data. They're in dataset 232a7352-d8eb-409f-a55e-8c245231a8b1

The E-plot starts at the SouthEast corner (i.e. that’s subplot number 1).   Diagrams for how the subplots are created are in file VS_Protocol_Eplots_March2014.pdf.
