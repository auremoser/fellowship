###To Dos Vital Signs
####Updates:
Things requested:
* ~~Can we use color to show which points have data and which don’t (e.g. ones with data = red), so we don’t spend ages hunting for something with data?~~

* ~~There need to be units on the y axis for the time series…  some of the datasets have this in the third column (that’s what all the “m”s are about), but typically the water levels are in metres (m), rain in millimeters (mm), flow (dmd) in cubic metres per second (m3/s).~~

* ~~The x axis on the time series is too wide - need to look at the time series over years, not days (there are seasonal variations that user is expecting to see).~~

* pull down new TZA_SAGCOT_gauging_station_details.csv
* ~~added TZA_clusters polygons (yellow)~~
* ~~dynamically named subtitles and units~~
* ~~fixed hover tooltips to display data type~~


####Questions:
* deal with the additional water gauging data 
* datatype 'name'?
