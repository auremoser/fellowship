CRISIS NET
===========
##CrisisNet
Crisis Data is important, stats are important; it finds formats and exposes crisis data in a popular webformat. Getting the data in people's hands quickly. 

There are lots of static data sources, UNOCHA and point and incident data, but then there's also steaming social media to consider.

Facebook pages streamed together for Syria and youtube information...syria chatter.

Cataloging information with keywords in english...only want to know relative instance of ... in ....

##Comparison Projects
**CKAN** is a nice library of APIS but doesn't allow you to access data at production scale. CrisisNet pulls from data updated every single second. CKAN (great way to browse) is static data. UNOCHA (humanitarian data exchange). CrisisNet (pulling info live)

**HDX** (un humanitarian data exchange project)

Monitor social and traditional media online...like wikipedia updates on an article.
