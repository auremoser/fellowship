fellowship journal
==================
## 2/2/2014
First day, en route to italy for the Ushahidi team summit in lake como.  

- read through Swiftriver and Crowdmap api instructions and wrote up notes for retreat
- schemed about developing custom Ushahidi toolkits for data journalist popup newsroom deployments at internews
- read through the data dredger database structure and diagrams
- consulted juan's curriculum (2 slide decs a day to get up to speed)
- prepared terminal flashcards for drive by on 2/7 and community call updates

Will do:  

- draft email to Eva about database comments and toolkits
- prepare schedule of regular checkins with both Eva and David
- bring ideas to ushahidi team meeting in lake como
- consider collab projects with other fellows


## 2/4/2014
Spent the last two days working with the team to develop some plans for future ushahidi projects. 
Got a pretty thorough project map of how the organization has developed and deployed projects since 2008 (inspired by the 2007 citizen coup). 
- altered a short script for project management (<http://ushahidi-auremoser.dotcloud.com/#>)

## 2/9/2014
Spent last few days on project meetings for V2/V3 and Crisis Net for the next year's worth of plans.

Added foundation.css to to project management script and sketched out ideas for the ushaverse; going to maybe model after the octoverse: http://octoverse.github.com/.

* Catchup: read email, learn something new
* Collaborate: email, call and contact people
* Create: build something, check things off task list
* Recap: Plan for next day and write up JOURNO

Planned on the plane for possible visualizations of the IFES Election/Violence data and wrote up a rough proposal for how to go about that build.
