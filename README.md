small repo to track tasks for my 2014 open news fellowship and manage them publicly

###issues
issues in this case have been purposed for easy task management between ushahidi and internews asks, as a way to track productivity of the fellow as well as expectations of partner organizations.
conventions of issue logging:
* issues are assigned to aurelia
* issue titles are prefixed with [TOPIC] and described briefly in title bar

Like so:
![Issues](https://raw.github.com/auremoser/images/master/issues.png)

* issue description includes links to accessory documents or "quoted" asks from other team members
* issue labels reflect the tagged filtering schema for organizing and managing issues by subject and priority

Like so:
![Labels](https://raw.github.com/auremoser/images/master/labels.png)


###participants
all organization members are welcome to submit issues, folders included in this repo will also track select fellow projects and index the accessory repos for all 2014-2015 work with Ushahidi and Internews-KE.
