Name of organisation 
Mozilla Open News

Please describe your area of work using three key words or concepts
I am a developer working for Mozilla Open News on partnerships with Journalism organizations in Latin America and East Africa. Three concepts:
* Humanitarian Crisis Mapping/Data Visualization (I subcontract through Ushahidi and Internews-Kenya to work on building visualizations for open source software that gives a voice to global citizens)
* Privacy and Cyber Security (I co-organized a conference on Post-prism practical privacy and security called Prism Break Up in NYC: http://prismbreakup.org/, and I've spoken at HOPE and other conferences about my guide to security for journalists, co-authored by Harlo Holmes and Barton Gellman: https://github.com/mozilla/DropItLike)
* Coding Education for Women (I run a nonprofit called Girl Develop It that teaches women how to code in low-cost classes throughout the US and Canada

Description of the organisation's work (max. 100 words)
Knight-Mozilla Open News is an organization that supports open source journalism projects and partnerships with newsrooms globally. As a fellow, I've had the opportunity to work for the past year with Ushahidi and Internews Kenya on citizen journalism, election monitoring, and sensor-driven data visualization throughout East Africa and the developing world. You can read more about the program here: http://opennews.org/fellowships/2014meet.html

Designation/Role
I'm a developer at Ushahidi and Internews (via Knight-Mozilla Open News), which means I provide a lot of data visualization and support development work for their open source projects. Most of my code is public on github, and can be browsed via the gh-pages branches that share the same name as each repo: https://github.com/auremoser/. I mostly work on front-end projects (JS/HTML/CSS) but occasionally to scripting in Python for data cleaning. 

Projects currently working on: 
This year marks the 30th anniversay of the first documented case of HIV in Africa, so I just wrapped up working on a visualization of the keyword vocabulary in the last 30 years of Daily Nation coverage on the topic, I've documented much of the project in these two repos: https://github.com/auremoser/hiv-30_zoom + https://github.com/auremoser/hiv-30_cluster. The gh-pages of those repos host the demo (http://auremoser.github.io/hiv-30_zoom/). I've been otherwise iterating on Ushahidi contract projects like Vital Signs visualizations of sensor data from water gauging stations, and the launch of Ushahidi Version 3 (https://github.com/auremoser/VitalSigns-water). Most recently, I worked on a visualization of the Open Street Map tagging schema for a talk on folksonomies at ConMapas: a Latin American mapping conference (https://github.com/auremoser/bkx-osm). Most everything I work on can be viewed on Github; I have many side projects in code.

Why interested
I've been involved in the privacy/security conversation for a few years now; friends drafted me into the ArtSec google group, which focuses on art production related to security materials and issues, and subsequently I organized a conference in NYC on the topic (Prism Break Up). I continue to speak on panels and at conferences on the importance of private learning and security in the humanitarian/hacktivist space, and have done heavy research on educating children on privacy for a recent application to the knight foundation: 

What do you feel are the major privacy threats facing gender and women's rights activists online? (max. 200 words)
Something I often tragically remark on, is how much easier it is for me to navigate fora and online developer-venues without critique/preference if I adopt an androgynous name.  The un-egalitarian netspace is always going to reinforce the vulnerabilities women suffer globally. Trolling and the general homogeneity of a lot of the developer community does affect considerably how welcome gender/women's rights discourse is online. So I think the threat model is less-targeted attacks and throttling, and more related to the replication of gender tensions in an even more hostile environment than our physical world. I'm happy to elaborate if that seems to fuzzy.

What do you feel are the digital security risks to you and your community, and do you use any strategies or tactics to mitigate these risks? (max. 200 words)
I moderate much of the commentary and traffic that filters through our Girl Develop It site. We have more that 6,000 female students for our coding classes in the NYC chapter alone (http://www.meetup.com/girldevelopit/), and it attracts a fair amount of hate mail and criticism from male developers in the city. 

Do you use any digital security tools? If so, which ones? (max. 100 words)
I've vetted and tested all of tools I recommended on my Dead Drops Talk repo with Harlo Holmes a few months ago (https://github.com/mozilla/DropItLike). Otherwise, I use Signal on iOS, and have tested Wickr, Telegram, Cryptocat, Threema and other chat apps to keep up with the privacy/secu async messages space. 

How will you share what you learn, and use the tools and techniques that you gain from this event, within your communities and networks? (max. 200 words)
I'm a fairly prolific blogger (http://algorhyth.ms/), but I also teach at my nonprofit, Girl Develop It (http://girldevelopit.com/), so I routinely host workshops on peripheral topics to programming. I also have a radio show with weekly syndication in Brooklyn NYC.

Have you ever worked as trainer or facilitator before? If so, please tell us more about your experience. If available, add a link to any websites documenting these trainings. (max. 200 words)
Yes, I've guest lectured classes at ITP and Girl Develop It on coding and open source humanitarian mapping projects, but I suppose the best record of my speaking can be found in online posts on talks I've given. 
Here's my HOPE 2014 talk with Harlo and Bart: http://new.livestream.com/internetsociety2/hopex2/videos/57135754
Here's my MIT Civic Media Lightening talk on Teleportation: http://vimeo.com/99248186

Have you ever produced any documentation, manuals or resources on digital security or privacy? If so, please tell us more about your experience and if available, please include a link to these resources. (max. 200 words)
Yes; I wrote a lot of the copy for our Prism Break Up site: http://prismbreakup.org/
And I co-assembled resources for Harlo, Bart and my talk on anonymous Dead Drops (a guide for journalists interested in Cyber Security): https://github.com/mozilla/DropItLike

Have we met before:
I've met representatives of Tactical Tech, and solicited Maya Indira Ganesh to speak at Prism BreakUp :). But I've never been to a training. We run a fair amount of trainings for Internews though, so I'm familiar with the structure.
