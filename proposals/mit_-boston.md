##Mapping 1[21.0.]0.1*: How to Teleport and Find Home

MIT Civic Media Pitch - June 2014

----

####ABSTRACT:  

The coolest thing I learned this year is how to teleport (with a VPN tunnel, proxies and data, that is), and how to re-define 'home' on the internet.

####DESCRIPTION:
I build open source crisis maps with Ushahidi and Internews-Kenya, and I deal with a lot of data with various levels of access, security, and privacy limitations, This work inspired me to explore alternative ways of mapping "home," when you travel frequently without promise of connectivity, or your internet is throttled because of government restriction or policy. Home is where the heart is and often that means where you find comfortable connections (family and friends); often, for me at least, that's on the internet. While living in East Africa (where my companies are based),  I struggled with feeble internet connections, and started thinking about what home means in terms of internet connectivity and content, considering ways of mapping or visualizing my position (not just x/y lat/long but also relative to speed and velocity of connectivity) like, connection speeds in Nairobi vs New York, and how that affects my proximity to "home" (127.0.0.1). It also led me to experiments with tunneling, with hardware hacks via our application BRCK, and proxy networks, not for privacy per se, but for a accessibility.

Travel is typically a way broaden your perspectives and boundaries and we don't equate internet travel with similar frontiers but maybe we should? Because it's still a frontier-ed space. What's a map to an internaut navigating (seemingly) without boundaries, and how can you tunnel "home"?

*pun : 127.0.0.1 as home and 101 as in mapping for beginners :D
