* opsec requires no equipment
* opsec is not reliant on digital prosthetics
* opsec is human and easier to teach than some encryption software


####successful practices 


*  know how to: store, communicate, transport, unsensitize and destroy info

comes from a series of procedures:

* clarity, brevity, security
* encryption, obfuscation, deletion

* some of the most complicated modifications are behavioral and not necessarily technical (opsec is tedious)
* understand the limitations of your tools
* assume most not-in-person 

* separate account names and codenames from personal life (popular and campy but mostly made fun of because it's often mismanaged)
* use secure email and https
* use anonymity and encryption software, VPN/Tor
* us public key encryption
* secure deletion and sanitization practice (temp files, recycle bin, wipe don't delete, contacts)  
* chat over prepaid mobile phones or payphones, assume everything not in person can be overheard


* calling to check in with a security firm/guards at a set time every day, with lack of call meaning there's a problem
* disabling location pinpoints on social media; not posting photos with identifying elements if they're embedded with a military unit
* source anonymity
* **reporter anonymity ("an employee of the New York Times in Damascus contributed to this post")**
* the most famous fuckup of all time in this vein was when Geraldo Rivera was embedded with troops in Iraq and drew a map of their plan/position in the sand/on camera. 

####notes
What is wrong with journalists?
How to model the threats

can talk about his own experience, pretty early adopter of privacy and security technologies

Secure Drop + First contact problem

Snowden, december in moscow (electronic material back to the US)
* encrypted ssh over anonymous channels

what is needed, a course on this 
scenarios
typical threat models (secure workflow)
