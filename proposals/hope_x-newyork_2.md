##RADICAL OPSEC @ HOPE
###STORIES
* http://www.cjfe.org/resources/features/risk-and-reporting-dangers-freelance-journalism-syria
* http://grugq.github.io/
* http://sitrep.globalsecurity.org/articles/100802641-opsec-and-wikileaks.htm

* opsec requires no equipment
* opsec is not reliant on digital prosthetics
* opsec is human and easier to teach than some encryption software


####successful practices  

* calling to check in with a security firm/guards at a set time every day, with lack of call meaning there's a problem
* disabling location pinpoints on social media; not posting photos with identifying elements if they're embedded with a military unit
* source anonymity
* reporter anonymity ("an employee of the New York Times in Damascus contributed to this post")
* the most famous fuckup of all time in this vein was when Geraldo Rivera was embedded with troops in Iraq and drew a map of their plan/position in the sand/on camera.
