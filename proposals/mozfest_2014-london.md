### Tempus Fugitives + Time Bandits: Around the World in 40 Timezones
####What will people learn/do?
This will be a session to learn and develop resources on the topic of timezones.

Timezones are tough to get over [1], tough to program [2], generally really frustrating and riddled with geographic boundaries, day light savings issues [3] and leap-rules [4]. They've been protested in the past [5], puzzled-over in the present [6], we plan to collaborate on an understanding of this puzzle we know as web-time, and talk about approaches, quirks and solutions we've come up with or come across in our own work.

From this, people can collaborate on how to best program the complex but ubiquitous topic of timezones, and better understand how to architect open applications that cater time to a global community.

####How do you see it working?
We see it starting as a loose conversation where we go over some examples of known and little-known timezone perils, and then collaborate on an etherpad to compile links and resources for programming timezones in multiple languages. We'd then like to then split into small groups and work on building out those recommendations and links into a short markdown guide for developers on the open web. We'll then migrate this to a persistent resources on github with submoduled projects and recommendations on a web-language basis (Python Timezone Resources, Ruby Timezone Resources...etcet). We have quite a bit of (regrettable) knowledge about this topic but we don't know everything, and so we'd love to learn from the collaborators who attend our session.

####Participants?
I think the way we've structured it (as a conversation and then a breakout session) is a good plan

####Outcomes
This will be staged as a working session where we compile resources for decrypting timezone issues, and talk through some clever hacks to make them work better for us, and for our application audiences. In the end, we'll compile them to a collaborative git repository where all of our notes and resources can support future progress on the timezone front and inform future understanding of time paradoxes in code [7-8].

##Upcycling Interactives: 
###Quirky, Reusable Code for your Freegan Friends

####What will people learn/do?
This session is a collaborative workshop meant to crowdsource fun but abandoned code projects and document their peculiarities for reuse. Often, we discover code quirks and make visually interesting mistakes in data viz or interactive development that are not immediately useful to us, but still interesting. These should be cataloged in some way so that other people can profit from the quirks we've discovered. Maybe you've adapted a Bostockian D3 demo that went strange and south but in a fun way. Maybe you learned something unique about parts of the world where projection boundaries warp and map tiles smush. Maybe you found something strange in the catastropic but painterly interaction between two libraries in JS.  Likely, these are not immediately useful to you, or you scrapped/fixed the code and moved on, but maybe your flub would be valuable for an art project, a 3rd party interactive, or even a thoughtful blog post by someone who has more time to delve than you do at the moment.  


####How do you see it working?
I see it starting as a brief topic presentation and a conversation. Participants will be encouraged to bring along projects or quirks they've discovered in developing news interactives, data visualizations, or online applications. We'll talk through some prominent examples and discuss how we can compile them into a Github repository of examples, descriptions and code for persistent reference and upcycling.

####Participants?
I think 10-15 participants would work well; but the more the merrier, and we'll split up into productive subgroups for discussion if that's the case.

####Outcomes
As an outcome, I'd like to assemble a light repository compiling everyone's contributed examples for "upcylcing" with a description and some code to demonstrate.

I'd then link to pipe it to a GitBook or another gh--pages resource to serve as a persistent reference that can be later added to and versioned.
