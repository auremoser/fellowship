LIBSEC: Libraries for Open Information, Security Education and Collaboration

###Summary (Required)750 characters

LibSec is a project to educate American youth about technology, privacy, and operational security at their local libraries. Staged as a pilot program in New York and Boston, LibSec hopes to develop and deploy open source kits for free education materials and training sessions around the topic of information security, encryption software, and privacy protection in a post-Snowden era. Geared particularly to the information-eager and ever-important inheritors of our future world, the program seeks to educate students (aged 8-18), and by syllogism their extended families, about the value of information and data security, and the contemporary provisions possible to ensure their protection via technology. With thorough national coverage and distribution potential, libraries serve as ideal hosts for the program. As long-standing advocates for the protection of patron records, citizen browsing habits, and independent educational and learning opportunities, libraries faciliate spaces of open information exchange and learning. Their outreach, open ethos, and particular provisions for youthful patrons make them the perfect incubators for the security conversations of tomorrow.



###In one sentence, describe your idea as simply as possible.
####[1 sentence limit] How would you describe the project in a tweet? Give us a straightforward explanation of how your project will function.

LibSec teaches kids about operational security and privacy protection via interactive educational programs in their local libraries.


###Briefly describe the need that you’re trying to address.
####[3 sentence limit] Give us specific examples of the target audience and any insights you’ve gathered/research you’ve done.
Right now, youthful demographics are the most prolific contributors to online communities, the most organically habituated consumers of technology products, the most consistent contributors to social networks and media sharing applications, and possibly the most apathetic voices in the conversation around privacy and surveillance culture.  This apathy is sometimes attributed to lifetimes of exposure and prolific self-publishing, but the responisibility for surveillance sensitivity isn't solely that of our youth; we can do better to provide free and version-able education in the values of privacy and appropriate security practice. LibSec is an attempt to do just that.


Both free and open institutions of information distribution, Libraries have recently partnered with the ACLU in Massachusetts to protect patron rights to electronic privacy, they've supported digital commons, built ambitious web-archives and and they've piloted programs of massive intellectual social work nationally; there are no other institions who are so non-distriminately provisionary for private learning, none who are so welcome to minors as the library (where children have not only their own section of the library but often their own librarians, programs, and staff available for consultation). Libraries are the bastions of private learning and open information, and their forays into electronic and technology education only bolster their mandate of providing accessible information to all. It is thus the responsibility of the libraries to inform and empower those citizens with the most modest means, and their program of affordances should gear increasingly to our most impressionalbe, under-funded, and precious demographics, in this case, our youth.

###What progress have you made so far?
###[3 sentence limit]
We have assembled research for a discovery phase to diagnose what types of curriculum might be most advantageous to youth: some balance been technical education in encryption and operational security, and more nuanced discussion of the current surveillance conditions vis-à-vis both electronic and physical security vulnerabilties. Understanding what "privacy" means colloquially to waves of generations raised with internet connectivity and social networking capability is part of this research. 
Independently, we've implemented security software and hardware, taught operational security to communities of adults and adolescents, and participated in panel and conference discussions on the topic of information privacy and open source development. Specifically, Sands has worked on content development for DiscoTechs, a Berkman Center (?) program focused on encrypted communication education in the Boston area. Thus, our plan is to leverage the Berkman/Harvard Library's H2O platform for this pilot project (http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/h2o) as well as Mozilla's Teach-the-Web Webmaker Platform for a versionable and distributable curriculum that could be written once, taught everywhere, tailored to local needs and interests, at any library in the world. As developers and librarians working actively in academic and open source software communities, we're embedded in the environments we hope to infuse with the LibSec program, and have assembled the research and contacts necessary to support successful pilot and scalable deployment of the project.


###What would be a successful outcome for your project?
[3 sentence limit] Be sure to tell us about the timeline — how quickly do you want to achieve this outcome?
Our project would culminate in the successful assemblage of a series of security education and training kits after about 5 months of research, development, and deployment. Here's how that might look:

2 weeks:
We would plan to complete the research discovery phase rather quickly, through assiduous interogation of curriculum avenues and interview tests with our target demographics (17 and under)
1 month:
From our corpus of resources, background knowledge and solicited research materials, we'd like to assemble the kits as versionable resources on github and subseqntly made available on a small site for the project using Berman's H20 as our base platform 
2 months: 
Testing with pilot communities, revisions, versioning of the base curriculum, corrections made public and trackable via our open and available respositories
3-4 months:
Assiduous documentation and preparation of the materials for national deployment and availability in all libraries
5 months:
Campagning and distribution at 10 major cities nationally, and test deployment with our network of Harvard, NYPL Girl Develop It, Hacks/Hackers, and partner coding education chapters in the open source and NGO space nationally

####Aurelia Moser
Both a developer and a librarian, Aurelia is a Mozilla Open News Fellow at Ushahidi and Internews Kenya. For the past 7 years, she's worked in domestic and international libraries and technology departments, developing open source software for crisis mapping, information security and data visualization. She's spoken and written prolifically on the topic of operational security and open library education programs, and in 2013 co-organized a conference in New York on the topic of post-PRISM education and preparedness, called PRISM Break-Up. Active in the coding education, open source, and privacy/security communities, she also coordinates the hub chapter of Girl Develop It, a non-profit that teaches women how to code in low-cost classes accross 26+ chapters in North America.

###Fill in the details
####Idea Description (Required)
Share additional details of your Idea. How will it work? Why do you think it might succeed? What questions do you have for the community? Don't forget that you can 'update this' in due course too.

- If LibSec/InfoSec lessons for kids, broaden or design so that they can interact/communicate with their parents about this too. Point being mainly that usually parents are just as clueless as children when it comes to InfoSec, so it would be good to provide some component that parents can learn from and engage their children about, using at least foundational vocabulary, common language, etc. etc. so the discussion can make the jump from `cp /lib /home`, insert /dev/null joke, etc. etc.

- The library is the perfect choice for education of this kind because they have always represented protection and access, democratization and community, and a trustworthy institution of knowledge. (how many government-funded buildings would you leave your kids in?) It only makes sense that they would take on the new role of educating the population about the implications of what it means to "access" information today, and (aside: almost like militias?) provide tools and resources for an informed citizenry. If the primary means and implications of accessing information have changed, no guardians makes more sense than libraries and librarians.

- Anti-Surveillance doesn't have to be anti-govt / anti-merican. Legitimate concerns of being surveilled / comm-opted by companies, cyber-war, etc. (in addition of course, to concerns about our own damn govt). Lots of reasons to educate and protect when it comes to children and comm.
