Stereo Semantics

www.stereosemantics.com <<<<DONT FORGET TO MENTION THIS


This episode's theme is slowness. We talk alot about internet slowlaning, and the slow data trend. The FCC was forced to extend the deadline this week for public comments on their Internet Slow Lane plan to midnight last night, so it seemed topical to address this at Hackers on Planet Earth, among internauts and their discontents. You'll hear some indie rock, psych/synth pop and electronic remixes with some cameos by comcast throughout this special episode of stereo semantics, the HOPE-10 slow lane edition.

It's also about the slow data trend, one defined by our ignorance of the more subtle trends in our culture, because in our preoccupation with social media and real-time feeds we ignore and slow stats and glacial pace of changes that really indicate techtonic cultural shifts and behavioral change.

Stephen Few wrote about it in The perceptual Edge, about slow data's analogy to the slow food movement. It's all about our rush to interpret, predict and prescribe action based on data...and how a more thoughtful and slow approach would better serve our analysis.

in charge of managing broadband deployment and regulating companies like AT&T and Comcast, but without actually ability to do so in a focused and effective way — and when it tries, it does so so badly that it gets spanked in court and loses.
