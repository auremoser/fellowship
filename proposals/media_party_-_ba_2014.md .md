####Drop It Like It's Hot: OpSec and Secure Drops for Data Journalists

####Description
We'll give you tips in how to secure your research programs and controlled inforshare on collaborative teams (with this as a takeaway: https://github.com/mozilla/DropItLike). And specifically, we'll demo how to use Ushahidi's newly developed BRCK (http://www.brck.com/) and our own recently developed KeyBlur application (https://github.com/mozilla/keyblur)to securely share files and information in places where internet infrastructure is limited or otherwise insecure.

####Time

Level: middle


####Attendee Background
We're both educators and developers, so it's not essential that attendees have a particularly specific domain knowledge since we're happy to teach anyone interested, but they should be ideally familiar with Github and general network infrastructure (just to make the explanation easier.

####Workshops outcome
We hope to enable everyone to set up a secure spin-up network and share information with collaborators on investigative or general research projects.

####Requirements
It would be great to have a projector to demo, but we can totally just work off our own laptops if that isn't available.

####KeyBlur and BRCK: Network Infrastructure at your Mobile Disposal

####Presenters
@auremoser, @harlo

####Description
With the help of other Knight Mozilla Fellows (Marcos Vanetta, Mike Tigas, Frederic Lindenburgh), Harlo and Aurelia worked on KeyBlur, a way of securely sharing documents on a spinup local network. Ideal for activists, investigative journalists, or even small rural schools, the project is meant to enable individuals with limited infrastructure but secure sharing needs to collaborate and exchange files and information on a local network. Likewise, we'll demo Ushahidi's BRCK project, an alternative spin-up network for sensor data collection and field work on the fly.
