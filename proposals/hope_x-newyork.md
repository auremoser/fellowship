####Drop it Like it's Hot: Secure Sharing and Radical OpSec for Investigative Journalists

Speakers:
Harlo Holmes, Developer @ The NYTimes + The Guardian Project
Aurelia Moser, Developer @ Ushahidi + Internews Kenya

Description:
As developer-journalists, we work with sensitive information about critical investigations of governments, institutions, and individuals domestic and foreign. The security and reliability of that information is of the utmost importance, and yet we work on collaborative teams of varying technical and subject expertise; managing our resources and notes while maintaining the privacy and safety of our sources can be complicated. The persistent mandate of our profession is to encourage information transparency and accountability, and this mandate informs our practical workflows as well as our policy with respect to investigative journalism.
This session will briefly review operational security in the newsroom, and demo tools and software that we've built and worked on to maintain the integrity of our workflow.

At Guardian Project (https://guardianproject.info), Harlo primarily investigates topics in media steganography, metadata, and the standards surrounding technology in the social sciences.  She harnesses her multi-faceted background in service of responding to the growing technological needs of human rights workers, journalists, and other do-gooders around the world.  Harlo is also 2014's Knight-Mozilla OpenNews fellow at New York Times, working with Aron Pilhofer, Sarah Cohen, and the Computer Assisted Reporting team to tackle issues of smarter, safer, and more effective document management.

As the 2014 Knight-Mozilla OpenNews fellow at Ushahidi and Internews-Kenya, Aurelia works on securing crowdsourced crisis maps and training journalists toward greater ops-sec and geo-caching practice for research. Ushahidi's tools for capturing crowdsourced information and mapping are often deployed in crises, election monitoring, and government corruption tracking projects; the objective is to capture, organize, and geocode citizen opinion without endangering the volunteer reporters and information providers. Likewise, Internews works to encourage the use of these tools to capture citizen perspective in countries where data journalism is not part of the traditional news-reporting practice. Training journallists and developers in pop-up newsrooms, we work to build the collection of data and dissemination of open information throughout East Africa, and build continuously an open curriculum to train data journalists.

This session will review those projects, some development process, and how we enable secure information share in the name of investigative reporting. We'll give you tips in how to secure your research programs, controlled (dead)dropping like it's hot, on collaborative teams. Commited to both open information and personal privacy, our respective work highlights open source software efforts to maintain stable communication on coordinated teams, securing the integrity of sensitive data in citizen journalism worldwide.
