LAYOUT PERFORMANCE
==================
* rendering is not being extended yet (extensible web manifesto)
* dont want to fork the web
* layout is generally really fast but layout management is not]
* there's no real smoothness api on web (like in apps)
* single threaded programming in the dom but the web has some parallelizing operations
* we have no api to measure text << BIG PROBLEM (text justification and glyph sizing)
* we have poor modes of metrics for layout performance and presenting the layout informaiotn
